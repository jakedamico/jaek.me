                    Jake is an aspiring software engineer based in
                    Ohio with a passion for web development and application engineering.
                    He also takes pride in his work in other interests such as launching products, finance and systematic trading,
                    as well as brand design. While he's an engineer and problem solver at heart, his other skills in business and design help
                    tremendously in being a well-rounded craftsman.
